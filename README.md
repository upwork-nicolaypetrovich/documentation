Documentation template that created with Progressive WEB App specification features. Page can be displayed without internet connection if it was downloaded at least one time. Also it has good PageSpeed and Google Audit scores.

It has lot of features that I can not describe here, like latest woff2 font that compressed to one file and stored in browser local storage - page has no need to even ask to download this font from the server again. I advise you to download a code and take a closer look.
